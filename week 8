#2 Answer
The authors of this work used three models—TL-CNN, Bayesian-CNN,
and Modified Bayesian-CNN—for classification tasks. Class imbalance 
is a problem for TL-CNN, which uses the VGG-16 architecture with transfer
learning and a pre-trained network to boost performance. In comparison to TL-CNN,
Bayesian-CNN handles data imbalance better by applying Bayesian concepts and 
considering weights as distributions to estimate uncertainties. By adding a stochastic
adaptive activation function, the Modified Bayesian-CNN improves upon the Bayesian-CNN
and further improves performance by decreasing erroneous predictions and enhancing uncertainty 
quantification. This updated model is more computationally efficient due to its reduced number
of parameters and increased accuracy and bias reduction.


#3 Answer
In this study, the posterior distribution of the weights in the Bayesian neural
networks is approximated using Variational Inference (VI). VI uses a more straightforward
, tractable distribution to approximate the genuine posterior, given its intractability.
To be more precise, a Gaussian distribution is assumed for the weights, and the mean and
standard deviation parameters define the variational posterior. Reducing the variational 
posterior's and the genuine posterior's Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is the aim.
This entails using gradient descent to optimize the variational parameters, enabling 
the model to assess uncertainty and generate probabilistic predictions in a computationally practical way.


#4 Answer
This work introduces an adaptive activation function to enhance the Bayesian-Convolutional 
Neural Network (Bayesian-CNN) performance. The adaptive activation function incorporates a 
probabilistic parameter that is learned during training, in contrast to normal activation 
functions, which are fixed. By modifying the activation function's behavior in response to 
the training set, this parameter enhances the network's ability to eliminate biases and better
adapt to intricate patterns. As a result, the activation mechanism is more adaptable and efficient,
which improves the model's capacity to learn from and generalize to the data.

#5 Answer
In this work, Bayesian techniques are utilized to quantify uncertainty so that the model
may evaluate the degree of confidence in its predictions. We take two kinds of uncertainty into account.
Aleatoric Uncertainty: This is a term used to describe the intrinsic noise in the data that cannot be
eliminated through model improvement. The noise in the data is measured by the variance in the predicted distribution.
Increased data or a more comprehensive model might lessen the uncertainty resulting from the model itself.
Epistemic uncertainty. It gauges the variation in forecasts brought on by inadequate model understanding.
By focusing on and identifying regions with significant epistemic uncertainty, the study uses these uncertainty measurements
to improve performance and enable more precise improvements and confident predictions.
