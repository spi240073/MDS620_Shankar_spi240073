There are two primary categories of machine learning: supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
Training a model on labeled data—where the results or classes are known—requires supervised learning.
Based on this labeled data, the model learns to map inputs to outputs, and its effectiveness is assessed
by contrasting its predictions with the known labels.
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, in which the model searches for structures, groupings, 
or patterns without knowing the results beforehand. Methods include dimensionality reduction and clustering.
One type of supervised learning is active learning. In order to improve the model's performance with fewer 
labeled instances, it entails querying the model to choose the most instructive data points to be labeled.
It uses labeled data to direct the learning process.
